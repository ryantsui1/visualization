# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```

- Overall good. Presents information well at a glance.
- Heat Map allows understanding of information at a quick glance and suggests patterns based on location of the country correlating with happiness.
- Happiness Difference is Clear and Ranked from highest to lowest change is easy to read, decipher, compare.

- Overall the visualization is appealing, has good information but focuses on the highlighting less relevant metrics.
- Specifically this is a great showcase of creator expertise, but I believe very poor to use in an actual business setting.
- Export to PDF is good function for Field Ops, but informaton is not targeted to Field Ops as interaction with Tooltips is required to give accurate information
- A lot of metrics don't explain what is happening... Ex. is this number YTD, what is this % based against?
- Title format is appealing but is actually distracting because the report lacks structure and direction + at a glance it looks like something.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```

Visualization 1: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/grow.with.google/viz/WorldHappiness_16003108197090/12_YearlyHappinessScoreChanges
- I would lock the map given data is only available for Europe
- I would default the year on the Happiness Map to 2017, given the Score change is calculating difference between 2015 and 2017
- Happiness Score Change would benefit from Data Labels for legibility, colour gradiant would make it look more appealing.
- Country Flags on the X axis data markers would help visibility.

- Let the user select year by year, but not select all of them together. 
  - This causes a major break in the scope consistency across the report. 
  - Then all the benchmarks are vs. Last Year to Date and completely solves this problem.
  - In my experience, there is rarely a need to bunch multiple years together unless it's a rolling timeframe which is not possible here anyway.
- In the Sales by State map, I would choose color only, having size bubble too makes it seem like there are 2 different metrics calculated and there isn't. There are also too many states to make reasonable comparisons on any other metric across 50 states using a size bubble unless you're catching major outliers.
- If this wasn't a portfolio showcase and actually a business report, I would only use one type of graph to display the same thing (choosing the simplist and non-flashy option), else it's harder to read than necessary. 
    - Sales by subcategory by month is actually near unreadable because tracking by colour depth obscures accuracy.
- I would add an option to flip all datasets to tables to get numbers easier if the user wanted to. Will show more data than top $ weights and allow for searching opportunites outside of top categories/states. 
- If 1st Manufacturer is "Other", better data quality is required but most likely wouldn't be the data visualizer's problem.
