# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        Your answer...
Visualization 1: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/grow.with.google/viz/WorldHappiness_16003108197090/12_YearlyHappinessScoreChanges
Accessibility
    - Visual seems to be colour blindness friendly running through https://venngage.com/tools/color-blind-simulator
    - Text is thin and may hard to read if vision is blurry.

Reproducibility
    - World Happiness scoring data could use some explaination to increase reproducibility.
    - World Happiness report is public so anyone can use the dataset and update the scope, but trying to resurvey for the data may be a different story
    - Unknown why this particular visual only includes countries defined as part of Europe.


Equitablility
    - The Data itself seems equitable given how this metric and visualization isn't used stated to be used for actionability (ex. prize / resource distribution) and is just for informational purposes only in this setting.
    - The visualization itself doesn't give any insight into the methodology of the World Happiness Score which may have some equitability concerns.
    - The visualization shows some correlation that geography has a correlation on happiness ratings.
    - Could argue that removal of other continents is inequitable as it may change interpretation of the visual & may reduce accessibility of information

        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Your answer...
Accessibility
    - Webpage fails to load in colour blindness detector but overall I find it hard to read and get precise information.
    - Multiple ways of displaying the same metric in different settings makes things timely to digest and I would say that lowers accessibility for users with heavy schedules
    - Arguably multiple different ways to show data, in a more fun way helps engage an audience which may dislike looking at lots of numbers. Increasing their accessibility to the information.

Reproducibility
    - Having so many different modules to present data in different ways arguably reduces reproducibility from a workload perspective.
    - Baseline information is not clearly stated which does impact reproducibility.
    - Assuming this is an internal dataset available to all intended data analysts, the data shouldn't be a barrier to reproducibility.
    - It counts sales by category, subcategory, Region, state which should be fields in the base datasets. Not having unique calculated metrics increases reproducibility.

Equitablility
    - I don't see anything with the dataset without more knowledge on how the company operates with their dataset.
    - Sales By Category Locks Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies into their spaces instead of sorting for top 3. That may be inequitable if these product lines are managed by different teams.
    - Manufacturer "Other" having so many sales may indicate some large manufacturers being unclassified and unfairly left out of consideration.
